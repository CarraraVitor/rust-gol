### Game of Life

simple game, just run it in the terminal passing a file containing the initial state as input.

usage:
```sh
rustc main.rs
./main <file_input>
```

there are some files with some cool patterns in this repo.
glider.txt is the classic glider.
big.txt is a bunch of stuff generate by AI.
small.txt is same stuff by AI, but in a smaller grid.

feel free to send me some cool inputs :)
